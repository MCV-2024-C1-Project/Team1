## Context

With the development of digital image processing technology, it has become imperative to find methods to efficiently search and browse images from large image collections. Generally, three categories of methods for image retrieval are used: **text-based**, **content-based**, and **semantic-based**. 

In daily life, people search for images mainly via search engines such as Google, Yahoo, etc., which are primarily based on text keyword searches. Prompted by market demand for search services, image retrieval has become an extremely active research area in the fields of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. 

Current image retrieval techniques are usually based on low-level features (e.g., color, texture, shape, spatial layout). However, low-level features often fail to describe high-level semantic concepts; thus, a 'semantic gap' exists between high-level concepts and low-level features. To reduce this 'semantic gap', researchers have adopted machine-learning techniques to derive high-level semantics.

**However**, in this task, we will focus on low-level techniques, specifically those involving histograms.

## Artwork Recognition Project

This project, developed over four weeks by **Team 1**, aims to create a model that can recognize a painting from a museum's database based on a given image. Upon recognition, the system will return the name of the painting and the artist. 

This project is being developed by **Team 1** using ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue)

## Project Overview

The project is structured into four phases divided in weeks, each contributing to the final goal of building an efficient artwork recognition model.

### Final Objective
- **Goal**: Given an image of a painting from a museum, the model will identify the corresponding artwork in the database and return the painting's name and its author.

## Week 1 Goal
- **Task**: Given a museum dataset and a query dataset, retrieve the **K most similar images** from the museum dataset for each image in the query dataset.
- **Method**: The system will utilize two methods:
  1. **Histogram Equalization**: A preprocessing step to enhance image contrast and improve the accuracy of visual comparisons.
  2. **HVS Histogram**: The HSV color space separates color information (hue) from intensity (value), which can make it more effective in comparison than RGB in certain scenarios, especially under varying lighting conditions.
- **Output**: The **K** images will be ranked based on similarity scores, with the most similar image at the top.

---

### Key Components:
- **Image Feature Extraction**: The project focuses on extracting features from images using histograms in different color spaces.
- **Similarity Comparison**: The extracted features will be used to compare and rank the similarity between query images and the museum dataset.
- **Final Model**: By the end of the project, the system will be capable of accurately identifying artworks and providing relevant information about the painting and artist.

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-27338e?style=for-the-badge&logo=OpenCV&logoColor=white)
![Numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=plotly&logoColor=white)
![Scipy](https://img.shields.io/badge/scipy-FF6633?style=for-the-badge&logo=spicy&logoColor=white)

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python plotly scipy
```
OR 

Use the requirements.txt file 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Make sure with the second method you have python version >=3.10

## Repository Structure

This repository contains five Python files and one Jupyter Notebook, each serving a specific role in the project.

### Files:

1. **data_loader.py**
   - Responsible for loading images from the dataset and preparing them for feature extraction.

2. **evaluation.py**
   - Contains the evaluation metrics and functions to assess the performance of the retrieval system.

3. **features_extractor.py**
   - Handles the extraction of features from images, such as color histograms, across various color spaces.

4. **retrieval_system.py**
   - Implements the main retrieval system that, given a query image, retrieves the most similar images from the dataset.

5. **similarity_calculator.py**
   - Computes similarity scores between histograms using different metrics to rank the results. In this file, we have implemented both OpenCV and SciPy because we found different metrics that can be useful throughout the project.

### Main Script:

- **main.py**
  - A main script used for testing, visualizing, and demonstrating the functionality of the system step by step.
